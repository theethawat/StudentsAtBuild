# Welcome to the Student Zone at Microsoft Build 2020!

We are so excited to provide support for you to not only learn by listening and watching, but by doing! 
Explore this repository to find starter code for some of the projects and demos from the Student Zone.

## What is Microsoft Build?
Microsoft's professional developer conference where, you guessed it, professional developers come 
to confer! By that we mean where developers come to learn about how Microsoft can better support their
unique developer journey. There are technical sessions, opportunities to meet and talk with experts, and 
the chance to discover and grow a technical community.

## What is the Student Zone?
Each year at Microsoft Build we create a session track specifically aimed at student developers. The target age
for our student developers is 14-21 years old, though that is really just there to guide us in scoping 
the content we create for you. So if you're a bit outside of these exact ages, you still might find this content 
useful for your coding journey!

## Where can I find the Student Zone Sessions?
First please register for the [Microsoft Build conference](https://register.build.microsoft.com/). 
Next, head over to the Community Connections and find the Student tab. Make sure to add all of the sessions to your schedule builder!

## How can I find the resources mentioned in the Student Zone sessions?
Here are some examples of the content and star speakers we have this year:
