# Microsoft Build 2020 - *an experience*
> Learning coding concepts from experts and afficionados all for free!

Although I have coded before, the idea of attending a developer conference seemed scary to me. I thought the content would go right 
over my head, or that I would feel antagonized as woman in CS. I was pleased to find that this wasn't the case. Through 
interactive sessions that were tailored for students and which featured several female presenters, I got the satisfaction of 
`Build succesful` rather than the frustration of a `Runtime Error`. I have learned a lot in these past 8 hours, and I hope the next 
two days will be better and better!
