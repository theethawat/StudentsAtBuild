# Jen Looper is loving MS Build 2020

> Hi everyone! I'll be doing a bunch of activities at MS Build 2020 but the one that students will love is a mindful programming activity: creating a terrarium with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - no filler! Enjoy some hand-drawn succulents and craft a draggable interface where you can situate your plants in a terrarium created with just CSS. It's actually quite relaxing!

To view the final terrarium, clone or download [the repo](https://github.com/jlooper/my-terrarium) using the Master branch. To code along with me in the session, use the Student branch, which is incomplete. There are steps delineated where you need to complete the code - don't miss edits to the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. 

When you're done, view the terrarium locally by opening index.html in your browser, or commit your code to your GitHub account and use GitHub Pages to view it.

To do that, go to your GitHub repo where your terrarium lives and connect GitHub pages to the appropriate branch (probably your master branch) in Settings.

Enjoy your lovely terrarium! And tell me what you think of the experience (I'm on Twitter @jenlooper)!
